At the beginning of learning code, I have always been fascinated by the website, CodeHS, and its style of creating shapes and solving problems.  This fascination has led me to pursue something in software engineering where I can use my skills and creativity to develop solutions. This website made me paint pictures with 2D shapes and sizes. 

One of the reasons I want to be a software engineer is the option to work on a wide range of programs and projects. 
Software engineering is a field that evolving, and learning about new technologies. I will have the opportunity to work on a large variety of programs. 

In addition to the challenges and teamwork, I am also motivated by the potential to make programs and update apps. Software plays an important role in modern life, from healthcare and education to business and entertainment. I will have the opportunity to work on projects and programs that have a real impact on people's lives.
