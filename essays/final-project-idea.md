# Final Project Idea: InterviewReady @ UH Manoa

## Overview

Many students at UH Manoa, as well as other local community members, lack sufficient opportunities for structured interview practice and documentation. This lack of preparation can hinder students' confidence and performance during actual job interviews.

InterviewReady is a mock interview scheduling platform specifically designed to serve UH Manoa students and local partners. The platform serves as a central hub for scheduling mock interviews and offers powerful features such as filtering by UH Manoa major and completed coursework. With a user-friendly scheduling view, email verification for authenticity, and a dedicated documentation page, InterviewReady creates a supportive environment for interview preparation that aligns with the needs of UH Manoa's academic programs and career pathways. For example, users can filter for students who have completed ICS 314 to practice skills related to Next.js.

## Mockup Page Ideas

1. Home Page

A welcoming page that highlights the platform, with a navigation bar allowing users to log in or register.

2. Dashboard

A personalized dashboard for each user displaying upcoming and completed interview sessions. It allows users to flexibly switch between interviewer and interviewee roles, fostering peer-to-peer support.

3. Scheduling View

A central scheduling interface with a layout that shows interview schedules and offers flexible filtering options (e.g., filter by date).

4. Profile Page

Each user has a profile page showcasing their skills, academic major, and preferred industries.

5. Documentation Page

A page providing curated resources (static links) on interview preparation and best practices.

## Use Case Ideas

1. Interview Practice for Students

Students create an account, complete their profile with their major and coursework, and then either open up slots or register for available interview slots.

2. Peer-to-Peer Collaborative Effort

The platform allows for flexible role switching without requiring separate accounts, so peers can offer or receive help depending on their current needs.

## Beyond the Basic

1. Curated Documentation

The platform's documentation will be developed with feedback from UH Manoa instructors to ensure it provides useful content.

2. Slot Limits for Fairness

A limit on upcoming slots per user will be enforced to ensure fair access for all participants (e.g., 10 interviewer slots and 3 interviewee slots per user).

3. Interview "Card" Details

Each interview card will contain essential details, including the interview time, interviewer's name, and a URL to join the interview (e.g., Zoom link).

This is a project built using Next.js, React Bootstrap, and PostgreSQL (Prisma). The platform will offer a friendly UI and robust functionality to help students become more interview-ready.
