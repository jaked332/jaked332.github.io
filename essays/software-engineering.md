### Before Majoring in Computer Science

During high school, I was initially drawn to the field of accounting, as I found satisfaction in the logical structure and problem-solving aspects of the field. However, as I was exposed more to the world of Computer Science, I began to see its far-reaching impact and realized that it aligned more closely with my growing interest in technology. Having always been interested in computers, it became clear that Computer Science is not just a subject, but a field where problem-solving and creativity intersect. This realization, combined with my passion for video games, prompted me to change my focus to the domain of software engineering.

### Game Development and Creative Expression

What excites me most about software engineering, especially within the context of game development, is the ability to create interactive, immersive experiences. For example, writing C# code in Unity allows me to build and shape virtual worlds, giving life to ideas that were once just abstract concepts in my mind. The process of developing games, from code design to building interactive environments, has opened up a world of creative expression that I find highly rewarding. This aspect makes software engineering particularly appealing for me.

### Future Aspirations in Software Engineering

Looking forward, I am eager to deepen my skills in game development, interactive media, and possibly animation. I see these areas as offering endless possibilities for innovation and storytelling. I hope to refine my expertise in full-stack development, game development, and algorithms in general to become a better software engineer and contribute to impactful immersive digital experiences.
