### Before Majoring in Computer Science

During high school, I was initially drawn to accounting, finding satisfaction in its logical structure and problem-solving aspects. However, as I gained more exposure to Computer Science, I began to recognize its broader impact and realized that it aligned more closely with my passion for technology. A high school coding project, where I created a simple application, was the turning point for me, as it revealed the creative potential within programming. This shift, combined with my love for video games, ultimately led me to focus on software engineering, where innovation and creativity thrive together.

### Game Development and Creative Expression

What excites me most about software engineering, particularly in game development, is the ability to create immersive, interactive experiences. Working with C# in Unity allows me to transform abstract ideas into dynamic virtual worlds. One of my most rewarding projects was developing a 2D quest game. Although challenging at first, I learned to integrate physics-based mechanics and interactive storytelling, deepening my understanding of game design principles. This process opened a new direction for me, one that continually inspires me to refine my skills and become a better developer.

### Future Aspirations in Software Engineering

Looking forward, I am eager to deepen my skills in game development, interactive media, and possibly animation. I see these areas as offering endless possibilities for innovation and storytelling. I hope to refine my expertise in full-stack development, game development, and algorithms in general to become a better software engineer and contribute to impactful immersive digital experiences.
