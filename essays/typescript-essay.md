JavaScript was the first language I learned, and it helped me understand the basics of programming, particularly for creating interactive elements for websites. Over the past couple of weeks, I've started learning TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. This capability enhances error detection and makes the code more readable.

In JavaScript, to write a function for adding two numbers, we can do:

```javascript
function add(n1, n2) {
  return n1 + n2;
}
```

In TypeScript, we can write the same addition function but with types:

```typescript
function add(n1: number, n2: number): number {
  return n1 + n2;
}
```

The benefit of writing the above code using TypeScript is that it would prevent unexpected behavior, such as adding a number to a string. For example, in JavaScript, `console.log(add(10, "10"))` is valid, but in TypeScript, passing a string instead of a number will be flagged as an error.

The athletic software engineering approach with its practice WOD exercises is new to me. Itâ€™s challenging but effective for learning under time constraints. While this method can be a bit stressful, I find it helpful in developing problem-solving skills.

Compared to other programming languages that I've studied, like C and C++, JavaScript and TypeScript are easier to learn and use. The WODs could be more difficult in other languages, but the approach is very compatible with the simplicity of TypeScript.

Overall, I think TypeScript is a strong tool to learn about, and the athletic approach is challenging but beneficial for becoming a better developer.
