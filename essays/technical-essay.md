I think that Javascript so far is a very  great moment to refresh my memory when I first started to learn Javascript. Java script was my first language that I learned during my coding times. In my second high school year, I went to a coding class. The first coding language is JavaScript. I believe that Javascript is a simple language to create 2d shapes on a small screen of a website. I think that Javascript is a great programming language in the way that I create a picture in a website known as CodeHS. 

This is my first time learning this kind of style where we write code in a number of minutes. The athletic software engineering is new as well with the WODS. The WODS are tough and exciting methods at the same time. This style of learning is great when it comes to Javascript. 
 
 Out of all the languages of my coding years. I will say that Java script is one of the basic languages. As I learned Java script in my high school times, I got an easy idea about creating the shapes. Java is more of a middle difficulty for me when it comes to writing code and throwing exceptions to get infinite loops. C and C++ is one of the hardest languages for me to learn and if the classes have those WODS, then it will be a challenge to know about every syntax of C and C++ in this learning style.
