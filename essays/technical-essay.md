JavaScript has been a great language for me to refresh my memory from when I first started learning to code. It was actually the first programming language I learned. In my second year of high school, I took a coding class where JavaScript was the first language we studied. I found JavaScript to be a straightforward language, especially for creating 2D shapes on a small screen, such as a website. I also think JavaScript is a great language for creating images on a website, like the ones I made on CodeHS.

This is my first time learning in a style where we write code in a limited amount of time. The athletic software engineering approach is new to me, especially with the WODs (Workouts of the Day). The WODs are challenging but exciting at the same time, and I think this learning style is particularly effective for JavaScript.

Throughout my years of coding, I would say that JavaScript is one of the more basic languages. When I learned it in high school, I quickly grasped how to create shapes. In comparison, Java is of medium difficulty for me; I find it more challenging when writing code and handling exceptions to avoid infinite loops. On the other hand, C and C++ are some of the hardest languages I've encountered. If we had WODs for those languages, it would be a real challenge to master every syntax detail in that learning style.
